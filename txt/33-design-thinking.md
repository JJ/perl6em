# Design thinking

If you have to design a project, you might as well do it well. 
This section has been mostly inspired by
[this document](https://dschool.stanford.edu/sandbox/groups/designresources/wiki/36873/attachments/74b3d/ModeGuideBOOTCAMP2010L.pdf?sessionID=e62aa8294d323f1b1540d3ee21e961cf7d1bce38) at Stanford University. *Design thinking* teaches you
how to think like a designer, which means thinking in a way that
allows you to create something that is satisfying for yourself and
that fills the need of a customer. In the free software realm,
oftentimes *you* are customer, so you will be satisfied twice for the
same low price. Anyway, there are several phases in thinking like a
designer. They are usually these ones.

## Empathizing

Find users, find out about them, care about them, know their stories. Maybe you are the user, maybe it's someone close to you.

## Definition

Define the challenge, what you want to do, express the problem. This
phase can be merged with the next one, since it is difficult to define
the problem without recourse about how you are going to solve the
problem itself.

## Ideate

Try to find out the solution to the problems your users have. 

In this phase you are supposed to produce ideas to solve the
problem. There will be no restriction other than whatever is required
by your target. You might want to create problems that imply certain
devices and not others, or solutions that cost no more than a certain
amount of money.

## Prototype

We will transition to actually doing something, incrementally. And
this is a phase, together with the following one, that is actually in
the engineering realm, so we are in familiar ground here.

## Test

If you are the user yourself, try it out. See if it is useful as
intended. Actually, test-driven design dictates that you cannot
actually prototype without testing in advance. So testing and
prototyping go hand in hand.
