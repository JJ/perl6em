<h2 id="org2a91943"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This book is about learning programming using a promising, and almost
completely new, language: Perl 6. But it is only Perl 6 specific in
a minority of the content. Most chapters that deal with Perl 6 could
be rewritten using any other language, preferably a new, cool language
such as Go or Rust. I, or someone, might do it some day. But for the
time being, let us be content with Perl 6. Which is also new and cool.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge7b416f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge7b416f">ℵ - Principles</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge7b416f">
<p>
A few principles that inspire this (book|booklet|manual|you name it),
originally conceived to help non-programmers get into Perl 6
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org37e904f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org37e904f">Learning should be fun and engaging: learn by doing.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org37e904f">
<p>
The best way to make people actually learn something is by putting
inmediately to practice whatever is being learned, be it programming
or weaving. So you should have your computer handy and learn the tools
as soon as possible to put things to practice. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb3dde57" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb3dde57">You are the master of your learning process, and tools, and outcome.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb3dde57">
<p>
You should learn at your own step, stopping whenever you want and
actually taking lessons when you feel like doing it. Engagement will
ensue. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb6c81fc" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb6c81fc">Learning never stops.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb6c81fc">
<p>
If you learn only during the short period where <i>class</i> is taking
place, you will not learn too much. You have to digest and assimilate
and come up with new ideas. Some of them will be relevant to whatever
you are learning, some of them will be revealed as relevant later on,
some of them will be simply discarded. But you can leverage whatever
experience you have to enhance what you are learning, even more so if
it is a programming language. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2f500ea" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2f500ea">Learning is a two-way process. There is no professor, no student: learning happens ideally in a community.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2f500ea">
<p>
This is kinda <i>zen</i>, but then the whole thing stinks of a holistic
experience, where you learn about life by learning about programming
dha back. That also means that learning comes from every direction at
once: the other students, maybe whoever is preparing objectives and
material for the day, but that person will also learn new things about
him or herself and about whatever is teaching, because the best way to
learn is to prepare something to be taught to others. 
</p>

<p>
Besides, there is no learning outside self-learning. But maybe that is
a completely different story. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org454586a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org454586a">б - Motivation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org454586a">
<p>
This is (mostly) a book on Perl 6. But my initial intention was not to
show how to program in Perl 6. Here are a few of my motivations, which
might be also your own for actually reading and following this book. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9c77baf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9c77baf">Teaching programming to (almost) non-programmers.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9c77baf">
<p>
Most programming books seem to be written eigther for people that already know
how to program or for people that barely knows how to press
keys. There must be a middle ground, and I try to tread it with this
book. If know how to use a computer, you should be ready to go the
whole nine yards and learn to create things in Perl 6 by the end of
the book, if that eventually happens. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org52fb6c3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org52fb6c3">Contemplate the possibilities of Perl 6 as a beginner's language.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org52fb6c3">
<p>
There seems to be a consensus that there is such a thing as a <i>good
language for beginners</i>, and that that language is Python. Well, maybe
it is, but why would any other languages, Rust, JavaScript or even C++
be worse? Asking about the best programming language for beginners is
like asking about the best foreign language for beginners. Evidently,
the best is the language you want to learn. If you want to learn
Chinese, you do not learn first&#x2026; whatever language is closer to
yours and easier than Chinese (maybe Vietnamese? No idea, really, I
got trapped in the metaphor). You learn Chinese and are done with it. 
</p>

<p>
Point is, when you want to learn to program you usually have some kind
of job or task in mind. The best language to learn programming is a
language that can do that job. And Perl 6 can be that language.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf43fde0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf43fde0">Show the beauty and craft of programming.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf43fde0">
<p>
"Good technically, but lacks passion" is probably one of the worst
things that can be said about a musician or even a footballer. Should
be the case also for programmers. Those focused on getting the job
done well <i>technically</i> will probably lack the will, or the stamina,
to learn new things or to completely switch the language or the
toolbelt you are using. Along with programming, you have to make
students learn the craft and also the beauty of a minimalistic, fast
and beautiful program. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org79e690a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org79e690a">Use project-based learning throughout and flipped-learning techniques.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79e690a">
<p>
Which boils down to "talk little, do a lot". No slides, no heavyweight
course materials, just a screen with examples, and make people perform
short tasks and reproduce what is being said by themselves. Hands have
better memory than eyes. Use that. 
</p>

<p>
In this book, in most cases activities will have a particular purpose
and will follow or flow from one chapter, or asides, to the next
ones, so that you will end up building one, or several, scripts
or programs or even notes that will be useful by themselves. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org218271b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org218271b">α - Design thinking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org218271b">
<p>
This has been mostly obtained from
<a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/sandbox/groups/designresources/wiki/36873/attachments/74b3d/ModeGuideBOOTCAMP2010L.pdf?sessionID=e62aa8294d323f1b1540d3ee21e961cf7d1bce38">this document</a> at Stanford University. <i>Design thinking</i> teaches you
how to think like a designer, which means thinking in a way that
allows you to create something that is satisfying for yourself and
that fills the need of a customer. In the free software realm,
oftentimes <i>you</i> are customer, so you will be satisfied twice for the
same low price. Anyway, there are several phases in thinking like a
designer. They are usually these ones.

<h3 id="orgb1ac15b"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Editors.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The choice of an editor goes beyond mere utility to become an
indentity, a side to stand when the flame war starts. As above, the
motto is always <i>suit yourself</i>, but since we are in the realm of
Perl6, I would propose <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a> as the editor to use. It is a modern
editor, it has got a good and evolving support for Perl 6, and it is
free software.
</p>

<p>
Not that the traditional Emacs and Vi/Vim are not good choices too. At
least Emacs, but Atom is easier to use and is improving in speed and
support by the minute. Besides, it has got everything it takes for
professional editor: syntax highlighting, being able to do some checks
from the editor itself, and allow running and debugging. It has got
all that, so that will be it. 
</p>

<p>
To go with the editor, you need some relatively fast way of inputting
some characters such as ሁ or Щ. I have used the application "Character
Map" that comes with Ubuntu; after finding a character by the name of
the alphabet, you can go to Character Details and copy/paste it to
wherever you want it used. You can also click twice and the character
will appear in the "Text to copy" slot.

the whole set of symbols that are out there by name using a
combination of keys. And it can also run a shell inside, your favorite
shell, in fact. So enter <code>emacs</code> and then type <code>Escape key + x</code> and
then, when a prompt appears in the lower line, <code>shell</code> and you will
have your shell running <i>inside</i> Emacs, with access to all kind of
goodies, like saving sessions as files, searching using all Emacs
facilities, and all kind of symbols that can be used in it.

<h2 id="orgceedf0b">ß - We need to talk about Unicode</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgceedf0b">
<p>
This does not belong to the language proper, but it is still something
that has to be mentioned. Languages are used to write applications,
and these can use any language in the world. <a href="https://unicode-table.com/es/">Unicode</a> is the way to use
any alphabet, and some <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/natlangs.htm">neographies</a> and emoticons, in our
programs. Luckily enough, Perl6 packs one of the best supports for
this; unluckily, Unicode is complicated <i>per se</i>, so we will have to
learn a bit of linguistics to understand how we, later on, are going
to handle this, which we will even if we write only for ourselves.
</p>

<p>
First important concept is the <i>codepoint</i>. A code point is pretty
much equivalent to a letter, although it can be a symbol or also a
formatting instruction such as Tab or Newline. Every code point
corresponds to a numeric combination, which is usually expressed in
hexadecimal; for instance, <code>0x2017</code> corresponds to the character <code>‗</code>,
part of a table-drawing set. Every character also has a series of
attributes, including the category; this character belongs to the <code>Po</code>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#General_Category">category</a>,
meaning that it is <i>Punctuation, other</i>. The <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/properties">properties</a> include a
series of attributes such as the fact that they are numeric or can do
things like folding to a particular case or be joined to the next
character, or even if the direction they are written in. 
</p>

<p>
Characters are written as <a href="http://mathias.gaunard.com/unicode/doc/html/unicode/introduction_to_unicode.html#unicode.introduction_to_unicode.grapheme_clusters">graphemes</a>, and usually a code point
corresponds to a single written grapheme; however, in some cases code
points group to form a <i>grapheme cluster</i>, which is a set of code
points that constitute a grapheme; the most common example is letters
with marks such as á, but more complicated expressions might be
thought of. Or not, depending on your imagination. 
</p>

<p>
You write graphemes and grapheme clusters as <i>glyphs</i>, or letters. And
these are typeset, in a particular environment, using <i>fonts</i>. A font
is a set of mathematical formulae, yes, there is math involved, that
allows to render a particular letter in many different sizes and forms
such as italics or boldface. The fact that they are a formula, and
that you have to design formulae for every single glyph, means that
not all glyphs might be available in all fonts. Some fonts will have
all, or most of them, some of them not. And that, in turn, means that
some Etruscan letter such as this one 𐌚 that renders beautifully in
your editor might show up as an x-marked rectanble or question mark
somewhere else, a console or a word processor. In fact, depending on
how you are reading this, you might not see the glyph I'm referring to
at all. Some other glyphs, like this jack of diamonds 🃋, will not show
up on your editor or even in a PDF document. However, you will be able
to see it in most browsers. 
</p>

<p>
Your take away message here should that you need to know how to use
Unicode in whatever program you use, and that some particular
structures of the program, like operators or names, will use graphemes
with particular properties, probably something alphabetic-like. Also
that unicode is complicated, but that you should better learn about it
as soon as possible, as in now.

<h2 id="orgd764ad8"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> The expressions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The first thing you need to know about a language, any language, is
how to compute things. Compute in the more general sense: combine
things to give other things. This, in general, is called expression,
which, also in general, is a bunch of symbols linked by <b>operators</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Generally, modern computer languages are able to work with many
different kind of symbols, and Perl6 is no exception. Let's start with
that.
</p>

<h3 id="orgbdc0f5f"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> REPLs and how to use them as glorified calculators</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>
is a Read-Eval-Print loop. it is a program included with most
interpreted languages, that presents a command-line prompt and into
which you can type expressions, and, later on, full statements. But,
for the time being, let's type
</p>


<pre class="example">
perl6
</pre>

<p>
And we will be into a perl6 REPL into which you can type Perl6 stuff.
</p>

<p>
Let's try the simplest thing:
</p>


<pre class="example">
To exit type 'exit' or '^D'
&gt; sin(π/2)
</pre>

<p>
You will have to find a way to type that π, by copy/pasting it from
some website or google or right this. It will return the sine of π/2,
which, as you know, is 1. 
</p>

<p>
And this is cool, because only some languages are able to handle this
kind of expressions, and, even more, to use it correctly in math. But
you can do even more:
</p>


<pre class="example">
sin(π/2) +1
</pre>

<p>
You can do that by copying/pasting, or else install <code>Linenoise</code>, a
command line that allows you to go back to previous command by typing
arrow-up. Do it with
</p>


<pre class="example">
zef install Linenoise
</pre>

<p>
You can use the usual arithmetic operators <code>+,-,*,/</code> but Perl6 adds
two typographic operators, ÷ and × (these ones are produced in the
Spanish keyboard with May+AltGr+ comma or period), like
</p>


<pre class="example">
sin(π/3) × sin(π/3) + cos(π/3) × cos(π/3)
</pre>

<p>
Or, even better
</p>


<pre class="example">
sin(π/3)² + cos(π/3)²
</pre>

<p>
One of the objectives of Perl6 is to use the whole range of characters
that Unicode, if not modern keyboards, offer. This simplifies
expressions and makes them more readable. 
</p>

<p>
You will not find all numbers in superscript mode. If you want to
raise a number to the /x/th power, use <code>**</code>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
3**25
</pre>

<p>
Arithmetic only takes you so far in programming. We will learn how to
deal, and operate, with all kinds of data in this glorified
calculator.

<h3 id="org7eff3c8"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Now that we mention Unicode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Unicode is the way to express all alphabets in the world, and then
some things that are not really alphabets. It uses up to around sixty
thousand symbols, and allows us to write, using modern operating
systems, editors and languages, anything that would have to be
expressed in living or dead languages, and even some
emoticons. Unicode is evolving constantly, and for the people means
that they will be able to use characters that are usual in their own
language, and also some usual in mathematical expressions. 
</p>

<p>
Since not all languages, editors, operating systems or even keyboards
are <b>modern</b> in that sense, some impedance should be expected. But
Perl 6 will not get in your way, allowing you to use them just they
way they should, so if you want to raise something to the second power
you will not have to, although you can, write x**2 but simply x².

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5203258" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5203258"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> It's not only numbers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
All the expressions written above are numbers. 
</p>


<pre class="example">
(sin(π/3)² + cos(π/3)²).WHAT
</pre>

<p>
is going to return <code>(Num)</code>, indicating that it is simply a Number,
actually a real number. This <code>.WHAT</code>, together with surrounding the
expression via parentheses meaning grouping, is a way to apply a
<i>property</i> or to call a <i>method</i> on that object. In Perl6, everythin
is an object, and objects have a class, and you want to call methods
that correspond to objects of that class, append a dot and use the
method, possibly with some arguments like <code>WHAT(is, "the",
$what)</code>. Let's not worry about that for the time being, or about
classes themselves. Just with the fact that every expression is an
object, and those objects belong to a class; every class in Perl6
<i>descends</i> from the ur-class called μ or <code>Mu</code>. And among the
<a href="https://docs.perl6.org/type/Mu">properties of Mu</a> is that you can call this <code>WHAT</code>. Any other class
descends from this one, so <i>you can call <code>.WHAT</code> on any object of any
class</i>. That is the take-home message, even if you might not know, so
far, what is an object, or a class. Second take home message:
<i>different objects also have different classes</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Since both <i>objects</i> at the sides of the <code>+</code> are Nums, you
can add or substract them or do any other arithmetic operation, but you cannot do 
</p>


<pre class="example">
sin(π/3)² + cos(π/3)² + " is 1"
</pre>

<p>
will yield this error
</p>

<div id="orgb1c8fc1" class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/expression-error.png" alt="expression-error.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Errorred expression in the REPL</p>
</div>

<p>
And the reason for that can be found out by typing:
</p>
<pre class="example">
" is 1".WHAT
</pre>

<p>
Which, whatever it is, is not a <code>Num</code>, so it cannot be added. 
That shows that there are more types of data you can use and work with
from the REPL. In fact, there are a lot. In general, you cannot mix
and match and, also in general, every one has got its own operators
you can work with. You can mix fractions with integer numbers, for
instance: 
</p>

<pre class="example">
⅓+4/3
</pre>

<p>
And 
</p>

<pre class="example">
(⅓+4/3).WHAT
</pre>

<p>
will return <code>(Rat)</code>, a Rational, same as <code>⅓+4</code>. In fact, most
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2015/02/a-little-thing-to-love-about-perl-6-and-cobol.html">floating point numbers in Perl 6 will be represented as rational</a>,
unless we explicitly tell the interpreter to deal with them as
floating point, that is real, numbers, which, BTW, cannot be something
else that fractional numbers since they use a finite representation in
computers. Mostly.
</p>

<p>
However, in some cases you can try and mix different things using an
operator. Operator "~" concatenates stuff, that is, joins things that
look like words and letters, for instance
</p>

<pre class="example">
6 ~ "6"
</pre>

<p>
will return <code>66</code>, and anything you put there will be concatenated. <code>~</code>
is an operator that is not picky about what it has got in both ends. 
</p>

<p>
You cannot add strings together, because that is what they are, but curiously enough, you can multiply them:
</p>

<pre class="example">
"1" ~ "\n" ~ "2" x 2 ~ "\n" ~ "3" x 3 ~ "\n" ~ "2" x 2 ~ "\n" ~ "1"
</pre>

<p>
This being a rather nice and utterly useless example on the operator
<code>x</code>, which <i>multiplies</i> or rather <i>replicates</i> whatever character of
string it is related to. Introduced together with =\n", the carriage
return, so that if forms a nice pile of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
Which is shorter and better in this example
</p>

<pre class="example">
for &lt;1 2 3 2 1&gt;  { say $_ x $_ }
</pre>

<p>
but that's something we will see later on, when we talk about loops
and all that's nice and beautiful about it.

<h3 id="org487b3bb"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Lists of things are also game.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
Numbers and words are simple things. But you can string them together
in something more complex. You can have sets of them, or lists of
them, or combine them as sets of lists of sets of whatever. Perl 6 is
great because you do not need to make all things in a complex
structure be of the same type. You can create a list with the less than
and more than sign, this way:
</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;a b 7 ⅓ π²&gt;
</pre>

<p>
And with lists, you can do things like sorting:
</p>

<pre class="example">
sort &lt;a b 7 ⅓ π²&gt;
</pre>

<p>
or combine lists to create a new one using the <code>X</code> operator, called
<b>cross product</b> 
</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;a b 7 ⅓ π²&gt; X &lt; → ← &gt;
</pre>

<p>
You can also combine in some other ways, adding one list to another. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;a b 7 ⅓ π²&gt; , &lt; → ← &gt;
</pre>

<p>
The simple <i>comma</i> operator is going to create a new list with two elements, each one of which is
a list. You can <b>flatten</b> it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
flat &lt;a b 7 ⅓ π²&gt; , &lt; → ← &gt;
</pre>

<p>
You can already do interesting things with these lists (or arrays, or
vectors, stuff in a row, whatever). For instance, you want to pick one
element randomly, 
</p>
<pre class="example">
(flat &lt;a b 7 ⅓ π²&gt; , &lt; → ← &gt;).pick
</pre>
<p>
will return, every time you run it, a different element. You can do
that as many times as you want, but it is much easier to use <code>roll</code> to
do it many times for you.
</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt; → ← &gt;.roll(6)
</pre>
<p>
will return a whole quiver of arrows.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you want a single element of the array:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt; → ← &gt;.roll(6)[3]
</pre>
<p>
This will return the 4th element, taking into account that all arrays
start with 0. Otherwise known as a random arrow. Or you might want to
extract a range
</p>
<pre class="example">
(flat &lt;a b 7 ⅓ π²&gt; , &lt; → ← &gt;)[3..6]
</pre>
<p>
uses the <i>range</i> operator <code>..</code> (that is, two points), which generates
a contiguous sequence of elements. Otherwise known as, well,
range. But these ranges also behave as arrays:
#+BEGIN<sub>EXAMPLE</sub> perl6
(0..10)[3..6]
#+END<sub>EXAMPLE</sub> perl6
although they are not exactly the same:
#+BEGIN<sub>EXAMPLE</sub> perl6
(0..10).WHAT
#+END<sub>EXAMPLE</sub> perl6
will, effectively, return <code>(Range)</code>.

<p>
This is just the start of complex structures with Perl. More to come
in the next chapters.

<h2 id="orgebbc0af">γ - Thinking like computers do</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgebbc0af">
<p>
You probably know, or at least have made an educated guess, that computers are unlike humans. But since
expressions are entered in pretty much the same way you would use
somewhere else, it's no big deal. However, once you want to
deconstruct what actually needs to be done to make a computer do
whatever you want it to do, you have to start to think like a
computer, in what is known as computational thinking. It is kind of a
game of "Simon says". You have to precede every instruction you give a
computer by something that indicates you want it to do precisely that,
and then you have to say very precisely what it needs to do.
</p>

<p>
But there is more to that, the fact that you also need to indicate the
<i>sequence</i> of actions you want the computer to do by indicating that
in your program. When you work with the REPL, as we have done above,
the sequence is quite clear: you say something, press Enter, the
computer thinks for a while or what looks like nothing, you have the
response. However, when the program gets a bit more complicated, you
also have to think, in a particular point in time, where the computer
might be and what that implies regarding values or results you need to
proceed. 
</p>

<p>
Which is why we talk about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking</a> as a series of techniques for solving problems
using computers, including all the steps you need to take to identify
the problem, put it in a way that can be understood and processed by a
computer, and then express every step as instructions in program that
will, eventually, solve the problem. 
</p>

<p>
We will get back to this later on, but for the time being there are a
couple of techniques you will need to understand. First is <i>pattern
recognition</i>, which means finding what several different pieces of
information have in common and, in turn, what to do to solve a problem
in a case given that you know how to solve it in another case which
follows the same pattern. When you find something that has a regular
increasing or arithmetic pattern, for instance, you will discover that
you can use lists or sequences to solve it, and apply whatever you
know already on how to deal with sequences. 
</p>

<p>
The second technique we should focus on right now is <i>problem
decomposition</i>, how to break down a problem in different parts that
can, more easily, solved. For instance, you want to find what would be
the number a sequence will reach if left to grow until infinity; first
you will have to solve the problem of representing the sequence, which
might not be inmediate, and then how to apply known techniques of
limit finding, such as
<a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/LimitsProperties.aspx#Limit_Props">finding the function that represents the sequence</a> and then applying
what is known about function limits to that sequence. 
</p>

<p>
Every part of a problem will eventually become an instruction or
group of instructions called usually <i>subroutines</i> or <i>functions</i>. But
for the time being, it is enough to know that breaking down a problem
in parts you already know how to solve is the key for solving problems
of any size.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
For long lists, you might want to use only the first and last term 
</p>

<pre class="example">
1...222
</pre>

<p>
via the <b>yada, yada, yada</b> operator, or, even better,
</p>

<pre class="example">
1 … 333
</pre>

<p>
But the coolest thing with lists is the stuff you can do to all of
them at the same time:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[+] 1 … 333
</pre>

<p>
will add everything together. Any operator you put inside brackets
will be applied to all in turn. Try <code>[*] 1 … 333</code>, for instance.
</p>

<p>
But the coolness factor can be increased:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[+] 1,3 … 333
</pre>

<p>
and even
</p>
<pre class="example">
[+] 1,3,9 … 333
</pre>

<p>
The <code>[]</code> is called a <i>reduce</i> operation. If you have heard some big
data buzz, you have probably heard about an operation called
<b>map/reduce</b>. Well, this is the <i>reduce</i> part. And it is so easy to do
with Perl6.
</p>

<p>
Because Perl6 is able to deal with arithmetic and geometric progressions out
of the box. And even infinite ones:
</p>

<pre class="example">
1,3,9 … ∞
</pre>

<p>
You can obtain the 100th term using
</p>

<pre class="example">
(1,3,9 … ∞)[100]
</pre>

<p>
or, why not, the terms from 1000 to 1100
</p>

<pre class="example">
(1,3,9 … ∞)[1000…1100]
</pre>

<p>
which will return a pile of numbers, separated by spaces. It is quite
usual to start from 0 and go to a particular number. The <i>caret</i> = ^ =
is used to indicate <i>0 to</i> the number that follows it
</p>

<pre class="example">
(0,5,10 … ∞)[^25]
</pre>

<p>
will list the 25 first elements of the list of multiples of 5. 
</p>

<p>
Besides, at the same time, we have seen how to deal with a single term in a
list, and how to work with a series of terms. You can use infinite
syntax to generate also finite lists if you do not want to compute in
advance the precise terms of it. For example, above you will be
working on the 1000th term and on of an infinite list, without working
out if it is exactly 3000 or some such. You can check out
<a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2010/12/04/the-sequence-operator/">this Advent calendar entry for a few samples of Perl6 coolness too</a>.

<h3 id="org9a9856e"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> Operating on lists</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
Lists are perfectly good subjects for this calculator on steroids we
have in the REPL. Whatever combination you think about, it is probably
possible to do it on lists; some of them will work also on infinite
lists, but most probably not. We have already seen <code>[+]</code> work on a
list of numbers. Any sensible operation like <code>[*]</code> will also work. But
this will also yield a result:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[~] 'a'..'z'
</pre>
<p>
collating together all elements in the alphabet. Preceding it with
<code>\</code>. which you can think of as an accumulator, will instead create
another array whose elements are the accumulation of the operation up
to that element. Better if you try it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[\~] 'a'..'z'
</pre>

<p>
This can be very useful when working on accumulative series, for
instance, what is the sequence of factorials up to 25?
</p>
<pre class="example">
[\*] 1..25
</pre>

<p>
This accumulator is called a <i>zip</i> operator. We will see later on what
it actually means, for the time being it just makes operating with
series a bit easier. 
</p>

<p>
But single lists only take you so far. Previously we have seen the
comma for kind-of joining two lists. But there are multiple ways of
creating new lists by combining them. For instance, the <i>cross</i>
operator <code>X</code> will create a list of lists from two of them
</p>
<pre class="example">
(1,3...10) X (2,4...10)
</pre>
<p>
will combine all even and odd numbers in pairs, combining 1 with 2 to
10, then doing the same with 3&#x2026; This can be useful if you want to
create a combination, but even more so if you turn <code>X</code> into a
hyper-operator by using it to precede any operation such as <code>*</code> 
</p>
<pre class="example">
(1,3...10) X* (2,4...10)
</pre>
<p>
will create a <i>flat</i> list with the results of multiplying the pairs we
have generated before. This can be useful for complicated arithmetics,
but sometimes we only want to pair a couple of lists to create a new
one that takes one element from each one, combining them like the
tooth of a zipper. This operation is appropriately named Zip and
represented by <code>Z</code>
</p>
<pre class="example">
(5,10...Inf)[^20] Z (4,8...Inf)[^20]
</pre>
<p>
This creates a new list that zips together similar terms in the
sequence of multiples of 4 and 5. Can we multiply them to create a
sucession of multiples of 20? Maybe&#x2026;
</p>
<pre class="example">
(5,10...Inf)[^20] Z* (4,8...Inf)[^20]
</pre>

<p>
You will never walk alone when solving a problem. Even if you are
working in a side project, something you thought about yourself, you
will need an easy way to keep track of changes and also to easily
incorporate whatever suggestions or even changes somebody else might
be doing to your code. And that easy way is to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">use git</a>. <code>git</code> is
described as a distributed source code manager, but it is much more
than that, it is a way of life. <code>git</code> organizes code in
<i>repositories</i>, pretty much corresponding to projects, but including
also artifacts such as documentation, manuals and examples. 
</p>

<p>
As a way of life, it needs much more than a single section in a
book. You will eventually learn as you go, but for the purpose of
this, let us say you have opened an account in an online Git server
such as <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. GitHub is free for public repositories, and even for a
few closed ones if you are a student. If you do not feel comfortable
with this, do not worry, you can use <a href="http://bitbucket.com">BitBucket</a>, which allows private
repositories with some limitations on the number of users and number
of repos.
</p>

<p>
Be that as it may, you will need a repository to store all the files
that you will be writing in this, maybe also your couse notes. It is
going to be fun start to create a single program, and keep changing it
over the same file; git will record changes and you will be able to
track your own progress over this file. In order to do that, create a
repository or project in any of them, and 
choose a sensible free software license, as well as Perl as a language
(closest to Perl6) and also generate a <code>README.md</code>, which is in
Markdown. 
</p>

<p>
That creates a git repository in whatever computer hosts GitHub (or
BitBucket), but git is a distributed system, and you can synchronize
your computer with the contents of the repository out there. Bring it
down with 
</p>

<pre class="example">
git clone https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo
</pre>

<p>
and please note I am using <code>https</code> here. You can also use the <i>ssh</i>
address and in fact you should, but for the time being let us let it
be. Remember to take down the username and password you have used,
because you will need later on.
</p>

<p>
That command will create a <code>yourrepo</code> directory hanging from wherever
you are. Change to it with <code>cd yourrepo</code> and start working there. For
instance, create a new file with <code>touch a_new_file</code>. Not everything in
the directory is <i>in</i> the repository, you have to purposefully add to
it. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
git add a_new_file

<p>
You are going to need in many cases whether something is true or
false: check if a file exists, check if a number is bigger or smaller
than another, or even check if a complicated local proposition is true
or not. In fact, everything in computers uses logic, to the point that
all information is codified using true or false values, what is called
a <i>bit</i>. There are so many layers over that that you do not need to be
much concerned about this, but you need to know about expressing logic
in programs, and specially in Perl 6, which is what we are dealing
with right now.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Let's see how Perl6 performs simple comparison operations
</p>

<pre class="example">
3 &gt; 2
</pre>

<p>
will return <code>True</code>, 
</p>

<pre class="example">
2 == 3
</pre>

<p>
will return <code>False</code>, because 2 is not equal (<code>=) to 3. Remember, =</code> is
used for comparison, and the rest of the operators are quite
usual. Whenever an operations can be true or not, it will return a
<code>False</code> or <code>True</code> value, and all these comparison operations
are. Perl6 adds another <i>smart</i> comparison
</p>

<pre class="example">
2 ~~ 3
</pre>

<p>
will return <code>False</code>, but
</p>

<pre class="example">
2 ~~ "2"
</pre>

<p>
will return <code>True</code>. The <i>smartness</i> of the operation means that it
will be able to recognize something even across different types, as in
this case, where we are comparing a number (or <code>Int</code>) with a <code>Str</code>. It
is even smarter
</p>

<pre class="example">
3 ~~ Ⅲ
</pre>

<p>
because it understands, as in this case, Roman numerals.

<div id="outline-container-orgafbac37" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgafbac37">‎ε - The command line</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgafbac37">
<p>
In the principle was the command line. That is so true. You run
scripts from the command line, and you go back to it when you are
done. But also the Linux was created with a set of command line tools
that can be integrated with your program to save you typing and
thinking and energy. There is so much you can do with it, that we will
need to know how it works, starting with organization of the disk
drive. 
</p>

<p>
The disk drive is nowadays mostly solid-state, or else it is so fast
you do not need to worry about it. Anyway it is organized like an
inverted tree, with the <code>root</code> at <code>/</code> and all branches and leaves
hanging from it. That tree would branch on <i>directories</i> or <i>folders</i>
and the leaves hanging at the far end would be <i>files</i>. In Linux,
branching is marked by <code>/</code>, so a file <i>this.is.a.file</i> in a folder called <i>jj</i> which is
inside another folder called <i>home</i> will be completely qualified by
<code>/home/jj/this.is.a.file</code>, or, sometimes, using web-style universal
resource identifier, <code>file://home/jj/this.is.a.file</code>. The characters
beyond the last period are usually called the <i>extension</i>. They are no
big deal, actually, just a part of the name, but they usually have a
conventional value for particular kind of files, like <code>.txt</code> for text
files and things like that. 
</p>

<p>
When you are working from the command line, you are always in a
particular directory, which is called the <i>working</i> directory. You
probably have used <a href="https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it">Bash it</a> or something like that to show it on the
command line; if you have not, well, do it now. <code>cd</code> is used to change
this working directory, and you can use absolute names or
abbreviations like <code>..</code> for the directory that contains your current
working directory. 
</p>

<p>
We have already seen a few things the operating system can do,
including the command <i>shell</i>, or command interpreter, which includes
some orders and also fetches program for you to run, and also
editors. But there are a few more orders that will be invaluable when
using Linux as a programmer.

another name
</p>

<pre class="example">
cp this.is.the.original.file ../to/this.is.a.copy
</pre>

<p>
will copy the original file to a directory called <code>to</code>, and with a
different name. <code>..</code> is the upper directory. Similarly,
</p>

<pre class="example">
mv this.is.the.original.file ../to/this.is.a.copy

<p>

Used to find files by name, it is invaluable when you do not remember
exactly where you downloaded your repo or you want to find an example

in the command line

<pre class="example">
find /home/thisisme -name "*.pl6" -print

in Perl6, in your home directory, as long as your username is
<code>thisisme</code>; change it to your username to apply it to your particular
situation.

<p>
<code>find</code> is, then, kind of like <code>ls</code> on steroids. <code>ls</code> will return the
